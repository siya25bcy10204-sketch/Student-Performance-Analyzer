# Problem Statement
Students often struggle to understand their academic standing based on their marks.
Teachers also require a simple digital tool to quickly evaluate , maintain student performance records.
Currently, most small-scale evaluations are done manually, which is time-consuming and unorganized.
There is a need for a simple system that can:
Store student details
Record marks
Automatically predict performance levels using rule-based AI logic
Easily retrieve and view student information
This project aims to solve that problem with a simple, menu-driven Python program.

# Scope of the Project
The scope of this project includes:
Managing student records
Adding new students
Storing student marks
Predicting performance
Based on marks, the system classifies performance as:
Excellent, Good, Average, or Poor
 Displaying data
View all student records
Search for any student by name
 User interaction
A simple menu-driven interface that allows smooth operation.
# Target Users
The primary users of this system are:
Students
To check their performance category based on marks.
 Teachers / Instructors
To maintain  student records easily.
Beginners in Programming
Who want to understand simple data handling and logic-based prediction.
 Academic Submissions
Perfect for students who need a beginner-level Python or AI fundamentals project.
# High-Level Features
Below is a simplified view of what the system can do:
1. Add Student
Enter name and marks
Automatic performance prediction
Save the record in the system
2. View All Students
Display list of all students
Show marks and predicted performance
3. Search Student
Find a student by name
Display their details
4. Rule-Based AI Performance Prediction
Marks → Performance Category
90–100 → Excellent
75–89 → Good
50–74 → Average
0–49 → Poor

Menu-driven

Beginner-friendly
